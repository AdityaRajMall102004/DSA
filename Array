1-WHAT IS AN ARRAY?
  An array is a collection of elements stored in continuous (contiguous) memory and accessed using index numbers.

2-WHY ARRAY IS IMPORTANT?
  Every programming language uses arrays for:
  ✔ Memory management
  ✔ Storing lists of data
  ✔ Searching
  ✔ Sorting
  ✔ DP tables
  ✔ Matrix & strings

3-CHARACTERISTICS OF ARRAY?
  1️⃣ Stored in contiguous memory
  2️⃣ Fixed size (in low-level languages)
  3️⃣ Direct (Random) Access
  4️⃣ Insertion + Deletion is costly

4-TYPES OF ARRAYS
  1️⃣ One-dimensional array
  2️⃣ Two-dimensional array
  3️⃣ Multidimensional array
  4️⃣ Dynamic arrays (Python list, C++ vector)

5-arr[i] = *(arr + i)

6-Patterns To Solve Array Problems
  ->Sliding Window-(Best for continuous subarray questions)
  ->Two Pointers-(Best for sorted arrays or shrinking/growing ranges)
  ->Binary Search on Array-(Used for sorted arrays or monotonic functions)
  ->Prefix Sum-(Used when problem has RANGE sum or differences)
  ->Hash Map + Array-(Used for frequency and grouping)
  ->Sorting + Greedy-(Used to get optimal solutions)
  ->DP on Arrays-(Used when problem depends on previous decisions)
  ->Monotonic Stack / Queue-(Used for "next greater/smaller" problems)

7-COMMON INTERVIEW TRICKS WITH ARRAYS
  ✔ If array is sorted → use two pointers or binary search
  ✔ If problem says continuous → sliding window or prefix sum
  ✔ If problem says longest / maximum → probably DP or sliding window
  ✔ If problem involves next greater → monotonic stack
  ✔ If problem involves range queries → prefix sum
  ✔ If problem involves K largest/smallest → min-heap or max-heap

8-Explaining all about patterns
  #Sliding window-
      Description: A sliding window is a subarray or substring that moves over data to solve problems efficiently in linear time.
      ->Fixed Size Window k
            ->(move window farward and add one element and remove the element that fell out)
            ->(Both pointers move together once window size becomes k)
      ->Variable Size Window
            ->(expand right end(r) until some condition or shrink left(l) end to optimize that condition)
            ->Variable window is commonly used in problems involving sums, frequency maps, and repeating characters.
      ->NOTE-->Two pointer also maintain l and r as like variable size window but it work on sorted array woth different logic.
